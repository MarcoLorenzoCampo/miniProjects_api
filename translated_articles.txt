Carlo Bonomi, the president of Confindustria, has stated that the recent decree on employment is just the beginning of a process. The government has limited finances, so they are focusing on cutting taxes on labor. Bonomi believes that this is an important signal, and that the real challenge will be cutting social security contributions in the next budget law. He is not satisfied with the tax breaks for new hires, stating that companies should be able to decide which professional profiles they need and hire accordingly. He believes that if there are resources available, they should be used to cut taxes on labor.

According to Sergio Di Dato, the head of the mobile clinic of Doctors Without Borders that provides assistance to migrants in transit between Italy and France, French gendarmes have started to reject unaccompanied minors at Ventimiglia in recent weeks. The French authorities are no longer able to accommodate unaccompanied minors in their reception system, so they have started to send them back to Italy, which is not allowed under the Berlin Regulation and other regulations. On average, the NGO reports 20-25 rejections from France to Italy every day, a figure that is feared to increase after the tightening of controls by Paris, which has sent 150 additional agents to the borders.
