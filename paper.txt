Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a 2006 Lego-themed action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts and TT Games Publishing. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars media franchise and the Lego Group's Star Warsâ€“themed toy line. It follows the events of the first three Star Wars films to be released: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over fifty Lego versions of characters from the series. Camera movement was improved from its predecessor Lego Star Wars: The Video Game. Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide. Critics praised the game for its comedic portrayal of the film series, which some described as "adorable". The game's low difficulty, and its handheld versions in general, were received more poorly. The game won a British Academy Games Award and a Spike Video Game Award.
