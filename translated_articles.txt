Tajani: FI has nothing to do with Mrs. Le Pen
(ANSA) - MILAN, MAY 5th - "Forza Italia is the center of the Italian government and politics. No extremism, we have nothing to do with Mrs. Marine Le Pen." This was stated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Tajani, on the sidelines of the Forza Italia convention in Milan. "I was not elected with her votes, we were elected with the votes of moderates and conservatives and not with hers - he added -. Giorgia Meloni is the president of the European conservatives and Le Pen is not with the conservatives, she is out of context. We have nothing to do with her, we are popular." To the journalists who pointed out to him that the leader of the Lega Matteo Salvini declares to be a friend of Marine Le Pen, Tajani replied: "It is legitimate for him to be so, but the center-right is not connected to Le Pen." (ANSA).

Intesa exceeds expectations, Q1 profit at 2 billion
(ANSA) - MILAN, MAY 5th - Intesa Sanpaolo beats analysts' estimates and closes the first quarter with a net profit of around 2 billion euros (1.96 billion), a strong increase compared to 1.04 billion in the same period last year and 1.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The result is driven by net interest income. For 2023, the bank expects a significant increase in operating profit, resulting from solid revenue growth driven by net interest income (net interest income expected to be over 13 billion euros in 2023) and a continuous focus on cost management, and a sharp decline in net value adjustments on loans, resulting in net profit growth to around 7 billion euros. Intesa Sanpaolo expects a strong value distribution with a cash payout ratio of 70% of consolidated net profit for each year of the business plan and a possible further distribution to be evaluated year by year. "The hypothesis of an increase in taxation on bank profits is being discussed, considering the revenue from interest margins increasing in the current situation of rising rates by the ECB. We will observe with respect any decision made by the government," says Carlo Messina, CEO of Intesa Sanpaolo. "At the same time - he adds - we hope that these additional withdrawals, in case new tax rules were to be applied, will be used to address the country's greatest social emergency, that of growing inequalities, by adopting measures for those who are facing greater difficulties."
